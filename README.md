## 🛠️ Currently Exploring
This semester, I'm deep-diving into subjects that are crucial for high-quality enterprise systems:
* **WIF3005: Software Maintenance and Evolution** (Building systems that last)
* **WIF3006: Component-Based Software Engineering** (Designing modular and reusable components)
* **WIF3008: Real-Time Systems** (Understanding time-critical execution and reliability)
